# This lab will discuss two ways of implementing the softmax, cross-entropy loss in Tensorflow, the 'obvious' method and the 'preferred' method. The former is the most straightforward while the latter is more numerically stable.

# Let's start by creating a dataset to train a multiclass classification model.

# make  dataset for example
centers = [[-5, 2], [-2, -2], [1, 2], [5, -2]]
X_train, y_train = make_blobs(n_samples=2000, centers=centers, cluster_std=1.0,random_state=30)




# The Obvious organization (Uncomment the code below to run it)
# The model below is implemented with the softmax as an activation in the final Dense layer. The loss function is separately specified in the compile directive.

# The loss function is SparseCategoricalCrossentropy. This loss is described in (3) above. In this model, the softmax takes place in the last layer. The loss function takes in the softmax output which is a vector of probabilities.
# model = Sequential(
#     [ 
#         Dense(25, activation = 'relu'),
#         Dense(15, activation = 'relu'),
#         Dense(4, activation = 'softmax')    # < softmax activation here
#     ]
# )
# model.compile(
#     loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(),
#     optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.001),
# )

# model.fit(
#     X_train,y_train,
#     epochs=10
# )

# p_nonpreferred = model.predict(X_train)
# print(p_nonpreferred [:2])
# print("largest value", np.max(p_nonpreferred), "smallest value", np.min(p_nonpreferred))


# Preferred organization
# In the preferred organization the final layer has a linear activation. 
# For historical reasons, the outputs in this form are referred to as logits. 
# The loss function has an additional argument: from_logits = True. 
# This informs the loss function that the softmax operation should be included in the loss calculation. 
# This allows for an optimized implementation.
preferred_model = Sequential(
    [ 
        Dense(25, activation = 'relu'),
        Dense(15, activation = 'relu'),
        Dense(4, activation = 'linear')   #<-- Note
    ]

# Notice that in the preferred model, the outputs are not probabilities, but can range from large negative numbers to large positive numbers. 
# The output must be sent through a softmax when performing a prediction that expects a probability. 
# Let's look at the preferred model outputs:
p_preferred = preferred_model.predict(X_train)
print(f"two example output vectors:\n {p_preferred[:2]}")
print("largest value", np.max(p_preferred), "smallest value", np.min(p_preferred))
print("These ^ output predictions are not probabilities!\n\n")
# The output predictions are not probabilities! 


# If the desired output are probabilities, the output should be be processed by a softmax.
print("If the desired output are probabilities, the output should be be processed by a softmax (see below)\n")
sm_preferred = tf.nn.softmax(p_preferred).numpy()
print(f"two example output vectors:\n {sm_preferred[:2]}")
print("largest value", np.max(sm_preferred), "smallest value", np.min(sm_preferred))

# To select the most likely category, the softmax is not required. One can find the index of the largest output using np.argmax().
